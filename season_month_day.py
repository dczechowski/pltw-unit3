#  The year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While the
#  exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because of the
#  way that the calendar is constructed, we will use the following dates for this exercise:
#  Season  First day
#  Spring  March 20
#  Summer  June 21
#  Fall    September 22
#  Winter  December 21
#
#  Create a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter
#  the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an
#  integer. Then your program should display the season associated with the date that
#  was entered.

def main():
  month = input("Enter the month: ") 
  day = int(input("Enter the day: ")    
    
    
# Start the program.
main()
