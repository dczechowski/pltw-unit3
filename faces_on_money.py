#  Write a program that begins by reading the denomination of a banknote from the
#  user. Then your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the
#  banknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message should be displayed
#  if no such note exists.
#  Individual         Amount(denomination)
#  George Washington  $1
#  Thomas Jefferson   $2
#  Abraham Lincoln    $5
#  Alexander Hamilton $10
#  Andrew Jackson     $20
#  Ulysses S. Grant   $50
#  Benjamin Franklin  $100
# Note: For this program, there is no reason to convert the input to an int. 
# The input is not being used in calculations.

def main():
  money = input("Enter the denomination of the banknote: ") 
    
    
    
# Start the program.
main()
