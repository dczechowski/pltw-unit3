#  Create a program that reads the name of a month. Then your program should display the number of days in that month. 
#  Display “28 or 29 days” for February so that leap years are addressed.
#  fyi see for string methods https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp 

def main():
  month = input("Enter the name of a month: ") 
  month = month.lower()  
    
# Start the program.
