#  A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. 
#  All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. 
#  An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different length. 
#  If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene. 
#  Write a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle. Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.
# Note: There is no reason to convert the input to an int for this program. The input is not being used in calculations.
def main():
  a = input("Enter the length of side 1: ") 
  b = input("Enter the length of side 2: ") 
  c = input("Enter the length of side 3: ") 
    
    
# Start the program.
main()
