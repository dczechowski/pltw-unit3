The Midtown Auto Company produced some models of cars that may be difficult to drive because the car wheels are not exactly round. 
Car models that exist are from 001 - 999. Cars with model numbers 100-200, 357, 468, 900-999 have been found to have this defect. 
Create a Defective Car Models application that allows customers to enter the model number of their car to find out if it is defective. 
If the user enters the model number of a car that is defective, display the message “Your car is defective. Please have it fixed”. 
If the user enters the model number of a car that is not defective, display the message “Your car is not defective”. 
If the user enters a model number that is not valid, display the message "Car model does not exist".

#  create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. 
#  If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message
#  indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program 
#  should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is
#  a consonant.  Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the
#  letter is a consonant.
